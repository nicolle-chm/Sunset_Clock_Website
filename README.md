# Sunset theme Online Clock

I enthusiastically took on the challenge from frontendmentor.io to create a functional virtual clock, and I decided to infuse it with my own unique twist. The result? A captivating virtual clock website with a soothing sunset theme that I personally tailored to align with my preferences.

Using a combination of HTML and CSS, I transformed this project into a daily companion, not just a timekeeper. The clock not only serves its functional purpose but also inspires me daily with a motivational phrase displayed at the bottom. It's a project that reflects both my coding skills and my passion for creating practical yet aesthetically pleasing web applications.
